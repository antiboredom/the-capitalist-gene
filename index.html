          <p>
            The dominant political narrative denies the possibility of any real alternative
            capitalism. This resignation to the status quo relies in part on a mostly unspoken but
            nevertheless always-present assumption that our current political, cultural and economic
            realities are fundamentally unalterable because they are products of "human nature"
            itself. The logical conclusion of this viewpoint is that capitalism has, in some very
            real way, a physical basis in our bodies, that capitalism is itself hardcoded into our
            DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Capitalist Gene is an initiative to tackle this assumption head on by collecting
            genetic samples from noted capitalists and capitalistic ambients, in an unprecedented
            cooperative effort to isolate capitalism on a genetic level.

            Everyone is welcome to participate in The Capitalist Gene. To do so, you will need to
            collect genetic samples from noted capitalists. A limited number of sample collection
            kits are available for order at no cost. You may also create your own sample collection
            kit.

              <h3>Locate a capitalist.</h3>
              A capitalist is a person that profits by exploiting the labor of others.
              <small
                >A capitalist is not a person who lives in a capitalist society. A capitalist is not
                someone who longs to be rich. A capitalist is not a person who likes going shopping.
                A capitalist is not a manger. A capitalist may or may not be a boss. A capitalist
                may or may not believe in capitalism. A person who is not a capitalist may say they
                are a capitalist. A capitalist is a person with a specific material relationship to
                workers. A capitalist is a person who owns capital. Capital is private property,
                which is another word for “means of production”, like a factory or a data center.
                Capital is not personal property like a phone or a t-shirt. Where should you look
                for a capitalist and how will you know if you find one? Think of all the people in
                your life. Are any of them capitalists? Think of all the strangers you see in the
                street and hear about in the news. Are any of them capitalists?</small
